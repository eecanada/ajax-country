# Description 

* AJAX Country is a toy application used to detect which country you are currently located at, and provide a bit of information on that country.
* A neighboring country will also load if the origin country has a neighbor.
* It was built in order to focus on asynchronous coding practices, dom manipulation, fetching API's, error handling, and producing and consuming promises.

# Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* CSS3
* HTML5
* Rest Countries API
* Geocode API
* Netlify
